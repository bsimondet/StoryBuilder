# StoryBuilder

Story Builder is an app for children who are just learning to read to support their engagement with words. It allows children to be presented with words that a parent or teacher has made available through Word River (https://github.com/bsimondet/word-river). The structure in Word River allows teachers and parents to manage words for individuals and groups of learners based on context. Those words are presented here for learners to select words to build sentences. When a child clicks on the word, it will be spoken aloud. When a child clicks on a sentence, the sentence will be spoken aloud. This support allows children to interact with words more independently than if this feedback were not available.

Story Builder was originally developed in Swift for iOS (https://github.com/casal033/StoryBuilder), but we are working to develop a version on Unity so that it can be deployed for use on a wider variety of devices.
